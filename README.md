👋 Hello there! I'm Greg - 
💻 I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for Bash scripting and automation. I enjoy finding creative ways to solve problems, simplify workflows, and craft efficient solutions with clean scripts.

🌱 Currently, I'm expanding my skills into Python programming and diving into the fascinating world of cryptocurrency and AI. I love learning about the intersection of tech and finance, and how we can use automation to do more with less.

🚀 I’m always looking to collaborate on interesting projects, especially those involving automation, crypto trading, and AI-driven tools.

🔍 Outside of programming, you’ll find me geeking out about sci-fi shows, gaming, or working on ways to integrate AI into website development and automation.

Feel free to reach out if you have similar interests or want to work on a project together!
